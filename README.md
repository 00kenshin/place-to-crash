place-to-crash
==============

PlaceToCrash web application, powered by sails.js.
It aims at providing a web interface for the application, as well as a RESTful API available to the mobile applications.

Application Description
-----------------------
PlaceToCrash will provide a way to easily spot places where your close friends live at the moment. It should allow you to easily planify road trips, by hopefully visiting several friends while on the road. It could also easily provide you for a place to crash when on a business trip or when you're far from home, when you'd rather not spend a fortune on a hotel.

Technical Details
-----------------
The project is only getting started, but the friendship relations shall be managed by the Graph Database Neo4J, and the application shall eventually be launched on Heroku.

Prerequisites
-------------
PlaceToCrash requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and npm, its package manager. Running 
    npm install
should install all the needed packages, including sails itself.
